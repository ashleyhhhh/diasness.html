<h1>Pre School</h1>
<p> Attending preschool at Antique Christian Center was a memorable and foundational experience for me. It was a place where I first learned the joys of making friends, exploring new ideas, and understanding the importance of faith and values.

The warm and nurturing environment created by the teachers made each day exciting. They were patient, kind, and always ready to guide us in our early learning journey. Mornings were filled with engaging activities, from singing songs and reciting prayers to learning the alphabet and counting numbers. The classrooms were bright and welcoming, decorated with colorful posters and student artwork that made the learning space lively and inspiring.

One of the most enjoyable parts of preschool was playtime. The playground was a place of adventure, where I spent time running around with my friends, playing games, and sharing laughter. It was also during these moments that I learned about teamwork, kindness, and sharing.

Apart from academics and play, Antique Christian Center instilled in us strong Christian values. Bible stories, prayer sessions, and moral lessons were an essential part of our daily routine. These teachings helped shape my understanding of kindness, respect, and gratitude from an early age.

Looking back, my experience at Antique Christian Center was filled with happiness and growth. It laid the foundation for my educational journey and played a significant role in shaping the person I am today. The lessons I learned, the friendships I formed, and the values I embraced continue to guide me in life. </p> </section>

<h1>Elementary</h1>
<p>Attending elementary school at Delegate Angel Salazar Memorial School was a transformative experience that shaped my early years. I vividly remember stepping into classrooms filled with enthusiasm, where dedicated teachers encouraged us to explore our interests and ask questions. The school environment was one of warmth and community—classrooms adorned with colorful artwork and inspirational messages that motivated us to strive for excellence.

One of the highlights was the balance between academics and extracurricular activities. Whether it was engaging in interactive lessons in science and math, participating in art and music classes, or playing sports during recess, every day was a new adventure. I recall group projects that taught us the value of teamwork and the joy of learning together. The school’s commitment to holistic development was evident in every aspect of our education, from moral values to intellectual curiosity.

Moreover, Delegate Angel Salazar Memorial School nurtured a sense of responsibility and respect. The guidance from our teachers helped build strong character and a passion for lifelong learning. Reflecting on those days, I appreciate how the lessons, friendships, and values I gained continue to influence me and guide my path forward.</p> </section>

<h1>Highschool</h1>
  <p> In 2020, I stepped into Grade 7, expecting a normal high school life, but instead, I found myself staring at a screen. The pandemic had turned classrooms into virtual grids of silent microphones and flickering cameras. Online classes were a mix of chaos and boredom—sometimes the internet would fail, teachers would struggle with technology, and I would feel like I was learning in isolation. But amidst the struggle, I found ways to adapt. I learned discipline, patience, and the importance of self-motivation.

Then came 2021, when I finally got to experience face-to-face classes in Grade 8. Walking through the gates of Antique National School (ANS) after a year of confinement felt surreal. Seeing my classmates in person, hearing the actual voices of my teachers, and feeling the weight of books in my hands again—it was overwhelming but exciting. There were new friendships, laughter in the hallways, and the simple joy of being part of something real. At the same time, adjusting back to traditional learning was tough, and we all had to rebuild the social skills we lost during quarantine.

Now, as I stand on the edge of graduation, my heart feels bittersweet. I look back at the past years—the fun moments, the struggles, and the unexpected lessons. High school was not just about grades and exams; it was about resilience, growth, and the friendships that made it all worthwhile.

Graduation is not just an end; it’s the beginning of a new chapter. But no matter where life takes me, ANS and the memories I made here will always be a part of me.</p> </section>
