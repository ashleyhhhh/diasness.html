<img src="C:\Users\USER\Desktop\ict\3.png" alt="Photo">
<p>My family is built on love, resilience, and unwavering support. My dad, Rizaldy, has always been a pillar of strength in my life, guiding me with wisdom, patience, and care. Through every challenge and triumph, he has been there, ensuring that I never feel lost or without direction. His sacrifices, hard work, and unwavering belief in me have shaped my dreams and given me the confidence to pursue them.</p>

<p> <h1>My mom</h1>  Louwelyn, though now in heaven, continues to live in my heart. Her love, kindness, and gentle spirit remain a part of me, shaping the person I am today. She taught me the true meaning of compas ion and perseverance, showing me that love transcends time and space. Even though she is no longer physically present, I feel her warmth in every memory, every lesson she imparted, and in the love she left behind.
Their unconditional love has been my foundation, reminding me that no matter what life brings, I am never alone. The values they instilled in me strength, kindness, and perseverance will forever guide my journey. Their love is my anchor, my source of courage, and my greatest blessing.</p> </section>

 <p> <h1>My Dad</h1> 
Rizaldy, is an incredibly strong and loving father. As an engineer, he’s hardworking and dedicated, but beyond his profession, he’s someone who has always been there for you. After your mom passed away, he carried the weight of both parents with unwavering love and support. He’s not just a provider but a protector, a mentor, and a source of strength.

He’s the kind of dad who stands by you no matter what, offering wisdom, guidance, and unconditional love. Even in difficult times, he remains a pillar of stability, showing you that family isn’t just about blood—it’s about being there for one another through everything. His love is quiet yet powerful, expressed through his actions more than words, making sure you always feel safe and cared for. </p> </section>


 <p> No matter where life takes me, I will always carry their love in my heart, knowing that I am supported, cherished, and deeply loved.</p>

<p> Beyond blood, my family extends to those who have stood by me through every challenge and triumph my friends. They are the ones who uplift me, share in my joys, and walk beside me in difficult times. To me, family isn’t just about lineage; it’s about the people who choose to stay, support, and love unconditionally. Whether bound by blood or by heart, my family is my greatest treasure.</p>
