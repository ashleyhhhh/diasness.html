  <p> Being a Media Artist in the Special Program in the Arts (SPA) at Antique National School for four years has been an incredible journey of creativity, growth, and passion. Throughout this time, I have honed my skills in various forms of media arts, from digital design to video production, storytelling, and photography.

Under the guidance of our dedicated media adviser, Sir Rod Spitanan, I have learned the true essence of visual communication how to capture moments, convey emotions, and tell impactful stories through the lens of media. His mentorship has been instrumental in shaping my artistic perspective and technical expertise.

But this journey would not have been the same without my media partner, Ashley Heart Villojan. From brainstorming ideas to executing projects,shooting and editing. the members of Multimedians has been more than just a collaborator they have been a constant source of inspiration, motivation, and teamwork. Together, we have tackled countless challenges, celebrated creative breakthroughs, and pushed each other to be the best versions of ourselves as media artists.

Looking back at these four years, I can confidently say that SPA at Antique National School has not only refined my artistic abilities but also deepened my appreciation for storytelling and the power of media in shaping perspectives. I step forward with gratitude, carrying the lessons, friendships, and experiences that have made this journey unforgettable.</p>
